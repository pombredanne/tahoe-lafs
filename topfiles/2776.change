Tahoe's testing-only dependencies can now be installed by asking for the
[test] extra, so if you want to set up a virtualenv for testing, use "pip
install -e .[test]" instead just of "pip install -e ." . At the moment this
only includes "coverage" and "pyflakes", but in the future it might include
"mock" and other utility libraries.
